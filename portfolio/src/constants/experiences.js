      "During my time at LHS I worked primarily on a bookingtool, which the company was planning to use for their customers. I was mainly responsible for the front-end development of the tool, which was built in Django. I also worked on the back-end, which was built with Django as well. I learned a lot about how it is to work with an actual customer. I also learned a lot about the software development process and how to work with deadlines. I had a great time at LHS and I am looking forward to my next opportunity!",

      "Seen I've spent three years studying and learning new things here, there are a lot of technologies I've worked with. But these are the ones I've worked with the most and that I think are the most important ones for my future. In the section 'Projects' you can see some of the projects I've worked on during my studies.",
