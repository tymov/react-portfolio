            "description": "For my internship at LHS by Spot, a small development company, we developed a complex booking tool and modular management system with a wide range of functionalities. The central aspect of the web application is the booking system, which enables customers to easily make appointments, reservations, or bookings based on availability. The system includes features for managing company resources such as rooms, equipment, and personnel, allowing for the tracking of availability and the assignment of resources and staff. Integration with a calendar is offered, allowing both customers and employees to view, modify, and keep track of appointments easily. The system also includes features for managing services and packages, enabling customers to choose the best options for their needs. A secure payment system is implemented to facilitate online payments for bookings, saving time and allowing for prepayments. The system maintains a database of customer information, including personal details, booking history, and preferences. It provides functionality for managing offers, promotions, and discounts applicable to customer bookings. Customers receive automatic email notifications when they make a booking or when there are changes to their bookings. Employees can view statistics such as the number of bookings and users, and access detailed histories of all customers and their booking records. The system also performs automated tasks and processes, such as optimizing the calendar and bookings. This project showcases our ability to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly web application tailored to meet the complex needs of a modern booking and resource management system. Our teamwork and prior experience allowed us to deliver a robust and efficient solution.",

Partnering with VITO, our project spanned across multiple branches of IT, including Cloud & Cybersecurity (CCS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Application Development (APP).\n\nTogether, my group, consisting of 3 APP students, 2 CCS students and an AI student, and I embarked on a mission to develop a comprehensive solution addressing environmental challenges through advanced technology.\n\nOur primary objective was to create a web application and mobile app capable of detecting an invasive weed species known as yellownutsedge. This endeavor required the seamless integration of expertise from diverse fields, fostering an environment of innovation and collaboration. In our group project, I mainly handled front-end development responsibilities, driving the creation of user interfaces. I also pitched in on back-end tasks when needed. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain insight into both front-end and back-end processes, enhancing my skills for future projects in software development. Engaging in this project provided me with invaluable insights and practical experience, particularly in areas I had previously explored but never at this scale. I'm not at liberty to share a lot of content about this project, like a demo or images that contain private information, I am allowed to show dummy/fake data to show the general feel of the project. It was a remarkable learning opportunity that not only enriched my academic journey but also prepared me for the challenges and opportunities in my future career endeavors.",

One of the highlights was implementing a privacy feature where trips were initially set to private, ensuring the creator's exclusive access. However, users had the flexibility to make their trips public, fostering a collaborative platform for sharing inspiration and ideas. While the project had its challenges, particularly as my first Angular endeavor, I embraced the learning curve and am proud of the result.
